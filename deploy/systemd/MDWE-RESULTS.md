# MemoryDenyWriteExecute vs the Node 22 JIT — empirical result

Build-plan §7 asks for `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` to be **tested** against the JS engine's
JIT rather than assumed. This is that test. Reproduce with
`bash deploy/systemd/test-hardening.sh` (user scope, no sudo needed).

- Date: 2026-09-04 · host: laptop2 (Ubuntu 24.04, kernel 7.0.0-31, systemd 255.4)
- Runtime: Node **v22.22.0** (V8 12.4), `systemd-run --user --wait --pipe -p MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`
- No sudo on this machine, so everything below is **user scope**. `ProtectSystem`,
  `ProtectHome`, `PrivateTmp`, `CapabilityBoundingSet` need a system manager and were not
  exercised; the seccomp-based directives, `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` and
  `RestrictAddressFamilies` are applied identically in both scopes.

## 1. Finding

| Case | Result |
|------|--------|
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`, default JIT, `node -e 'console.log("ok")'` | **ABORTS** (`SIGTRAP`, core-dump) |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`, default JIT, hot loop | **ABORTS** |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=no`, default JIT (control) | ok |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`, **`--jitless`**, hot loop | **ok** |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`, `--jitless`, `sodium-native` (hash, `sodium_malloc`, `mprotect`, `mlock`) | ok, `secure=true` |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`, `--jitless`, `udx-native` bind | ok |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`, `--jitless`, `corestore` → `rocksdb-native` append/get | ok |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`, `--jitless`, `WebAssembly` | **absent** (`typeof WebAssembly === 'undefined'`) |

**Node 22 with its default JIT does not survive `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes` at all** — it
dies during startup, before user code runs, so this is not something a "mostly interpreted"
workload can dodge. The abort is V8's own check, not a signal from the kernel:

```
# Fatal error in , line 0
# Check failed: 12 == (*__errno_location ()).
 2: V8_Fatal(char const*, ...)
 3: v8::base::OS::SetPermissions(void*, unsigned long, v8::base::OS::MemoryPermission)
 4: v8::internal::MemoryAllocator::SetPermissionsOnExecutableMemoryChunk(...)
 ...
11: v8::internal::Factory::CodeBuilder::AllocateUninitializedInstructionStream(bool)
```

V8 allocates a code-space page and `mprotect`s it executable; MDWE turns that into `EACCES`
(13); V8 only tolerates `ENOMEM` (12) there and calls `V8_Fatal`. `--jitless` makes V8 run
Ignition-only with no code space, so no page is ever made executable and MDWE is satisfied.

## 2. Cost of `--jitless`, measured

The seeder's CPU-bound JS is the NUT-12 DLEQ / secp256k1 work in `@noble/curves` (pure JS,
BigInt-heavy); Hypercore hashing is in `sodium-native` (native, unaffected).

| `@noble/curves` 2.4.0 secp256k1 verify ×200 | ms / verify |
|---|---|
| default JIT | 1.27 |
| `--jitless` | 2.11 (**1.66×**) |

Not free, but not the 5–10× a tight-loop benchmark suggests: noble spends its time in BigInt
runtime calls either way. At ~2 ms/verify one core still clears ~500 verifies/s, far above
the per-block payment rate of any plausible stream count. Native code (`sodium-native`,
`udx-native`, `rocksdb-native`) is unaffected.

`--jitless` also removes **WebAssembly** entirely. Nothing in the seeder/gateway runtime path
uses it (`nostr-tools`'s optional `nostr-wasm` is an opt-in subpath, `sodium-universal`
resolves to `sodium-native` under Node, `@cashu/cashu-ts` → `@noble/*` pure JS). If a future
dependency needs wasm on the server, the choice is between dropping MDWE and dropping that
dependency — record it here.

## 3. `RestrictAddressFamilies` — the plan's literal set breaks the swarm

Tested alongside, because it is the other §7 directive that can silently kill the daemon:

| `RestrictAddressFamilies=` | `os.networkInterfaces()` | `new HyperDHT().ready()` |
|---|---|---|
| `AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX` (§7 verbatim) | `ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR` | **throws `EAFNOSUPPORT` in the constructor** |
| `AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX AF_NETLINK` (units) | ok | ok, socket bound |

`hyperdht` → `dht-rpc/lib/io.js:39` → `udx.watchNetworkInterfaces()` → libuv `uv_interface_addresses` → `getifaddrs(3)`, which opens a `NETLINK_ROUTE` socket. Hence `AF_NETLINK` in both units. It is read-only route/interface enumeration; no capability is granted, and the units still have `CapabilityBoundingSet=` empty so `NET_ADMIN` operations over netlink are impossible.

## 4. Decision (as shipped in the units)

```
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node --jitless …
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX AF_NETLINK
```

Reasoning: MDWE removes the W^X bypass class entirely (a memory-corruption bug in a native
addon or in V8 cannot stage shellcode), the measured cost is ~1.7× on the one CPU-bound JS
path, and every native module the seeder/gateway load was verified to work under it. If a
host proves CPU-bound, the operator's escape hatch is a drop-in that sets
`MemoryDenyWriteExecute=no` AND removes `--jitless` **together** — one without the other is a
crash loop (see the last row of the test table).
