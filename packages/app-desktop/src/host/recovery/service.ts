/**
 * The desktop's NUT-13 recovery phrase (ADR 0016, issue #3): one phrase per device, sealed here
 * and copied to the user's relays NIP-44-encrypted to self; the balance held before it reissued
 * once into seeded outputs, the fee shown first; a restore scans every phrase the identity can
 * reach. Core's phrase, seed and restore code (lane N1) is taken by injection (`./core.ts`).
 *
 * Flows (each started by the renderer naming an ACTION, throttled like the signer's connect —
 * a page that keeps re-opening dismissed prompts is paused — and one at a time):
 *
 *   setup    no phrase yet: generate → show it in main's prompt window (`recovery-show`, word
 *            INDICES) → nothing is kept unless the user answers "I wrote them down" or "Later"
 *            (a closed window discards it) → seal it (NIP-44 to self) while no money plane holds
 *            the wallet, and reopen the plane, which now derives from it → publish the relay
 *            copy → confirm three random words (`recovery-confirm`; "Later" leaves it
 *            unconfirmed) → plan the reissue per mint → main's NATIVE dialog shows amounts and
 *            fees → reissue.
 *            A phrase whose reissue did not finish: only the reissue runs again, for the mints
 *            not yet reissued under it (each one recorded in the envelope as it moves).
 *            A finished phrase: rotation — re-authenticate first, then as above; the old phrase
 *            is kept on this device as `.retired` (restore reads it) and its relay copy retired
 *            once the reissue under the new one completed (`replaces`, kept until a relay took
 *            the retirement; the next setup retries it first).
 *   show     re-authenticate (the local key's passphrase in the prompt window; a native confirm
 *            for a remote signer), then show the words again; an unconfirmed backup may be
 *            confirmed then.
 *   restore  requires this device's own phrase in use (the seam's restore lives on the seeded
 *            wallet, docs/contract-requests/N2-nut13-desktop.md item 2); an optional typed phrase
 *            and mint addresses (`recovery-restore`, checksum re-checked here by core), this
 *            device's phrases (current and retired) and every relay copy the identity decrypts —
 *            read ONLY here — each scanned from counter 0 at the wallet's mints and the typed
 *            ones, with progress, and one report row per mint. Lane W8a: a scan core's batch cap
 *            stopped is CONTINUED from where it stopped (core's `resume`), call after call, up to
 *            `RESTORE_ROUNDS` calls per phrase and mint per restore; one still unfinished keeps its
 *            cursor in this process, so the next restore goes on from there.
 *
 * Lane W8a also: nothing moves at a mint while an operation is journaled there, and such a mint —
 * whatever is spendable there, dust or nothing included — keeps the reissue pending while the
 * operation is young and the mint answers; once every entry there is overdue, it counts done — as
 * does any balance at a mint that cannot be asked — but WATCHED: remembered in the envelope
 * (`watchedMints`), and the backup reopens once such a mint shows a spendable balance worth moving;
 * a replaced phrase's relay copy is retired only once nothing at all is left outside the new phrase
 * (the rule: `reissueAll`, `watchCheck`, `outsideLeft`; fix rounds 8 and 9); the relay copy is
 * retried, with a bounded backoff, until a relay took it (`relayCopy` in the envelope is the
 * persisted "pending" flag, and the status reads it), and so are a replaced phrase's retirement and
 * the watched mints — outside the flows' lock, which a flow waits for (bounded) instead of being
 * refused; the play sessions are closed through the worker before a reopen, so their tails carry
 * what the worker reported unpaid.
 *
 * Secrets: the entropy exists as bytes (zeroed after use), inside the NIP-44 plaintext (a JS
 * string, which cannot be wiped: ADR 0016 §2 residual) and as word indices in the prompt form
 * and answer (numbers, zeroed as far as JS allows). No word, index or entropy is ever logged,
 * returned to the renderer or put in an error: the renderer gets states, counts, amounts and its
 * own mint URLs; errors are codes and fixed sentences (anything else becomes `internal`), and
 * log fields are allow-listed reason codes.

   *     counts in `reissueFailed` (it is not covered). A plan the PAY/melt gate refused (a PAY
   *     there still building) is not that: it keeps the reissue pending, as before;
   *   - an operation journaled there, after the plan settled what it could: NOTHING moves there
   *     (F55) — a send or melt whose answer is unknown holds inputs the plan leaves out, and a
   *     pending operation's change derives from the phrase it was made under; moved now, the mint
   *     could not be recorded, and every "Finish backup" would move it — and charge its fee —
   *     again (core plans every proof held there, the seeded ones included). And what the entry
   *     holds (a PENDING melt's inputs, a lost send's inputs or change) may come back HERE, under
   *     the phrase it was made under, however little is spendable there now (round 9: F56 counted
   *     dust and empty mints done, and nothing ever moved what came back). A YOUNG entry (under
   *     `PENDING_SETTLE_AFTER_S`: it settles within that, or the mint reports it pending) keeps the
   *     reissue pending (`blocked`); once every entry there is overdue — a melt the mint still
   *     reports PENDING, a mint the settle cannot ask — done but WATCHED, and a balance worth
   *     moving there still counts in `reissueFailed`;
   *   - nothing journaled, nothing worth moving (nothing spendable, or dust: the mint's fee eats
   *     the whole balance): done — never asked, never recorded (F56);
   *   - otherwise planned, asked, moved and recorded.
   * A watched mint keeps "Replace phrase" available and is remembered in the envelope
   * (`watchedMints`): the backup reopens once it shows a spendable balance worth moving
   * (`watchCheck`). What the backup leaves out — dust, a watched mint — keeps a replaced phrase's
   * relay copy (`outsideLeft`). A mint the envelope cannot watch (not https, or the list full)
   * keeps the reissue pending instead, as before.
