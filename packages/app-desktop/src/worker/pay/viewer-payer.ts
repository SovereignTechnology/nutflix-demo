/**
 * ViewerPayer — the worker as a VIEWER toward the seeders it downloads from (build-plan §5
 * "pay after verify", SECURITY.md invariant 1): L3's `UpstreamPayer` (`@sovit/gateway/upstream`,
 * `range.core` on every `PAY`, replay guard, `PRICE` split, HELLO-gated) driven by an
 * INJECTED `pay(range, seeder, policy)` (design §1 "Wallet and engine": Stage 1 = the
 * `MockPaymentEngine`'s viewer side behind `--dev-mocks`; Stage 2 can move the engine to the
 * host behind the same function).
 *
 * What this adds around `UpstreamPayer`:
 *
 *   - **settlement for the `CreditPool`**: every block downloaded from a peer is owed until
 *     that peer ACKs the `PAY` covering it. The payer keeps a FIFO of the PAYs it put on the
 *     wire per peer (by decorating the peer's `sendPay`) and matches ACKs by
 *     `(core, fromBlock, toBlock)` — v5 `ACK` names its core (L6-C request 3), so two cores
 *     with coinciding ranges can no longer be confused. A block from a peer without `pay/1`, of a core we
 *     have no policy for, or owed to a peer that disconnected, settles at once (nothing more
 *     will ever be paid for it; the seeder decides what that means for us).
 *   - **spend events**: one `onPaid` per PAY (amount = both proof sets, mint, blocks), which
 *     the host uses to debit its wallet (design §1) and the session uses for its totals.
 *   - **policy**: always the MANIFEST policy of the core (what the user was shown and agreed
 *     to: price, split, creator P2PK). A seeder that asks more per block than the manifest is
 *     not paid (never pay more than the price shown) — the price it asks for THOSE blocks, which
 *     `UpstreamPayer` compares: the core's `PRICE` once one covers them, else the HELLO's. A HELLO
 *     above the manifest is no refusal by itself (F54): a desktop seeder's HELLO states a ceiling
 *     over every video it serves, and each core's own price comes as `PRICE` before its first
 *     block (ADR 0012 §4). The HELLO's own split is ignored (a seeder cannot re-route the
 *     creator's share); the mint paid at must be one the video lists (the host's wallet is
 *     debited there).
 *   - **one seeder per block, credit per seeder** (security review F33, issue #8): every core it
 *     watches is routed by the shared `SeederCredit` — a block is asked of one seeder at a time
 *     (hypercore's racing "hotswap" is off; a stalled request moves to another seeder, never to
 *     two), and a seeder is asked only while its own window (HELLO `windowBlocks`, widened for
 *     the manifest's minimum PAY) has room. The `CreditPool` follows the sum of those windows and
 *     PAYs batch to half each seeder's window.
 *   - **a PAY refused "for now"** (ADR 0012 amendment 2026-09-25): any failed PAY leaves its
 *     blocks owed — the session stays up and nothing reaches the seeder, so its window is never
 *     exceeded (no ban). The host answers `rate-limited:` while a melt runs at the PAY's mint
 *     (nothing spent). With every credit unit held by those owed blocks no download may come, so
 *     the payer asks again by itself. Lane R6-reconcile: that is `UpstreamPayer`'s one retry
 *     mechanism, no longer a timer of this class — `rate-limited` is DEFERRED there (asked again
 *     after `PAY_RETRY_LATER_MS`, doubling up to `PAY_RETRY_LATER_MAX_MS`, never given up: a melt
 *     may last 300 s), every other failure is transient (fix round 5: its own backoff, given up
 *     only after `PAY_GIVE_UP_MS`). Never in a loop: streaming pauses during the melt and resumes
 *     after it.
 *   - **the unpaid tail** (lane P2-owed-viewer, ADR 0018 amendment 2026-09-26). With a `record`
 *     (`UnpaidRecord`), every block received from a seeder with a verified HELLO is recorded
 *     under that seeder's pubkey and core, with the terms of the play session it was received for
 *     (`termsFor`); a PAY built for it takes it out at once — never paid twice, even when its ACK
 *     never comes (as a refused PAY is never re-sent) — and so does any ACK of it.
 *     What is left when a session closes, the app quits or the link drops is the tail. When a
 *     seeder later reports blocks it still counts (`OWED`), only those this record also holds are
 *     handed to the payer (`UpstreamPayer.addOwed`): paid at once, at the terms recorded, under
 *     that session's id (`payOwed`: the host checks it like any PAY — the session while it is
 *     open, its tail authorisation afterwards). An owed range the host refuses for good leaves the
 *     record (respected, never paid); what the seeder reports beyond the record is never paid, and
 *     `SeederCredit` keeps it off that seeder's credit. The record is also `SeederCredit`'s
 *     durable ledger (see `unpaid-record.ts`).
 *   - **images** (ADR 0015 amendment): `attachImageCore` routes a core read for display — a
 *     seeder is asked for it only after its `PRICE { free: true }`; nothing is paid or recorded.
 *   - **lane W8b-p2p (round-8 review)**:
 *       - an `OWED` on one connection of a seeder never hands over a block that another LIVE
 *         connection of the same seeder pubkey (another node behind one HELLO key) holds pending
 *         or in flight — that one pays it; one block is never paid on two connections. What
 *         such a connection drops unpaid stays in the record for the seeder's next report;
 *       - a PAY's removal from the record is written AHEAD of the send (`removeNow`), so a crash
 *         after the send cannot bring those blocks back to be paid twice;
 *       - an owed range the host refuses for now (no balance, a mint down, the tail file) is never
 *         dropped from the record: `UpstreamPayer` keeps it owed and retries it on its backoff;
 *         only a final refusal, or terms it can never be paid at, removes it;
 *       - owed blocks handed over are kept per CONNECTION (Noise key) and forgotten with it.
