/**
 * What a finished package must look like (issue #6, ADR 0017), checked on every packaged output
 * before it counts (Forge `postPackage`), alongside the fuse read-back:
 *
 *   - `resources/app.asar` exists and there is no `resources/app/` folder (OnlyLoadAppFromAsar
 *     would refuse to start from one anyway);
 *   - main, the host and the renderer are PACKED (inside the archive, so on macOS/Windows the
 *     integrity fuse covers the code that holds the wallet and the signer);
 *   - the worker boot module, its bundle and the DLEQ thread's entry (`UNPACKED_FILES`) are
 *     UNPACKED regular files: never a symlink, nor under a symlinked directory, either of which
 *     could lead Bare out of the app's own directory. A missing thread entry would not stop the
 *     app (its worker would check every PAY's DLEQ proofs inline, on its event loop), so it is
 *     refused here;
 *   - bare-sidecar's runtime for this target is unpacked and executable (the host refuses it
 *     otherwise);
 *   - no other platform's `bare` runtime was shipped.
