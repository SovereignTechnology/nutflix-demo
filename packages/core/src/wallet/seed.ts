/**
 * The NUT-13 recovery phrase and this device's counters (ADR 0016; issue #3). A LOCKED file
 * (SECURITY.md §locked): it imports only `@scure/bip39` (ADR 0016 D4, Cameron 2026-09-25) and
 * `sodium-universal`, plus the seam's types (`recovery-api.ts`).
 *
 *   - **The phrase** (`recoveryPhrases`): 12 English BIP-39 words over 16 bytes of entropy, made
 *     by the library's CSPRNG. The words leave core only as indices 0..2047 (`toIndices`); a
 *     typed phrase comes back through `fromWords` / `fromIndices`, whose error names the problem
 *     (`length`, `word`, `checksum`) and never a word.
 *   - **The seed** (`toSeed`): `mnemonicToSeed(words, '')` — the empty BIP-39 passphrase other
 *     Cashu wallets use — copied into `sodium_malloc` memory at once, the library's copy zeroed.
 *     `seedBytes` lends that buffer BY REFERENCE to the wallet (cashu-ts holds `bip39seed` so);
 *     after `wipe()` it is zero and `seedBytes` refuses it, and so does every derivation
 *     (`spend.ts` `seedGuardedOutputs`).
 *   - **The counters** (`DurableCounterSource`): cashu-ts's `CounterSource`, keyed by keyset id
 *     across every mint (two mints announcing one id still never share a counter), persisted
 *     through the shell's `CounterStore` AHEAD of use: before a counter is handed out, a lease
 *     reaching `COUNTER_LEASE` past it is on disk, so a crash burns at most one lease and never
 *     hands a counter out twice. A keyset the stored state does not know is PROBED first, at the
 *     mint the operation runs at and nowhere else (NUT-09, one batch: anything this seed already
 *     signed there is skipped), whether the state is new or lost. The stored state is bound to
 *     ONE phrase (`counterBinding`): a file another phrase wrote reads as no state at all, so a
 *     rotated phrase starts at its own counter 0 (independent review 2026-09-27, finding 3).
 *
 * Residuals (ADR 0016): the phrase strings the library builds (`entropyToMnemonic`) and the
 * words typed into the prompt window are JS strings, which cannot be wiped; cashu-ts's own
 * derivation intermediates (noble's BIP-32 and HMAC state) are the library's to clear.
 *
 * No cryptography is implemented here: BIP-39 is `@scure/bip39`, secure memory is libsodium.
 * Nothing here logs; errors carry a code, never a word, a seed or a counter's secret.
