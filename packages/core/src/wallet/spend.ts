/**
 * The wallet's spend operations — NUT-11 P2PK send, NUT-03 receive, NUT-05 melt, NUT-04 mint —
 * thin over `@cashu/cashu-ts` (SECURITY.md §locked; build-plan §3 "wallet surface = mint quote,
 * P2PK send, swap, melt"; contract `Wallet`).
 *
 * Rules this file keeps (each has a test):
 *
 *   - **One operation per mint at a time.** Proof selection and the swap run under a per-mint
 *     lock, so two concurrent sends can never select the same proof.
 *   - **State before result.** Every swap's transition (inputs spent, change / received proofs
 *     added) is committed to the `ProofStore` before the caller sees the result — a crash can lose
 *     a result the caller never saw, never proofs the wallet forgot it holds.
 *   - **Never trust the mint's output shape.** A P2PK send's outputs must add up to exactly the
 *     amount, carry a DLEQ that verifies against the keyset (with the blinding factor, so the
 *     recipient can verify it too — threat T7), and be locked the way `payment/lock.ts` requires
 *     (plain lock to the recipient, the requested binding tags, nothing else).
 *   - **An ambiguous failure is reconciled, not guessed.** If a swap fails after it may have
 *     reached the mint, the inputs' state is asked (NUT-07): unspent inputs stay in the wallet,
 *     spent ones are dropped and the loss is reported by count and amount.
 *   - **A lost response loses nothing (ADR 0014, security review F31).** Where the store keeps a
 *     journal and the mint supports NUT-09, a send, receive, mint or melt writes its outputs to
 *     the store BEFORE the request goes out; if the answer never arrives, the outputs the mint
 *     signed are restored (NUT-09) and committed as if it had. A retry of the same receive or mint
 *     reuses the journaled outputs, so a mint that did execute answers "already signed", never
 *     twice. A melt's journaled outputs are its NUT-08 change blanks (ADR 0014 amendment).
 *   - **Held inputs are nobody's.** While a journaled send or melt is unresolved, its inputs stay
 *     out of every new selection (and out of the balance, `wallet.ts`) until the mint says what
 *     became of them — they are neither spent twice nor forgotten.
 *   - **Nothing secret in an error.** Messages carry a code and amounts, never a proof.
 *
 * With a recovery phrase (NUT-13, ADR 0016; `MintConnections.seeding`):
 *
 *   - **Output types are explicit per operation**, never cashu-ts's `'auto'`: a send's change and
 *     the outputs of receive, mint, melt and reissue are deterministic (counters from the shared
 *     `DurableCounterSource`) at a mint that can restore them (NUT-09, a hex v1/v2 keyset);
 *     random elsewhere. A send's P2PK outputs stay `p2pk`: NUT-13 derives no NUT-10 secret.
 *   - **A restore counts as executed only when the mint shows it ran** (NUT-07: a swap's or a
 *     melt's inputs SPENT; a mint quote ISSUED). Signatures on our outputs without that are a
 *     COUNTER COLLISION — another wallet derived the same counters from this phrase — never our
 *     operation: the entry is dropped (its outputs are someone else's, so it can never run), the
 *     counters move past what the mint signed, and a live operation is retried ONCE with fresh
 *     counters. Committing them instead would drop inputs that are still unspent.
 *   - **Restore from a phrase** (`restoreFromSeed`, ADR 0016 §5): under the mint's lock, after its
 *     journal settles; every hex `sat` keyset, active or not, at most 32; batches of 100 until
 *     three in a row come back empty, at most 200 per keyset; each signature's keyset and amount
 *     checked, its DLEQ REQUIRED at a NUT-12 mint and checked against the key of the amount the
 *     mint CLAIMS (so an amount lie fails), and at a mint without NUT-12 the proofs are swapped
 *     into fresh outputs before they count; SPENT proofs dropped (NUT-07); what is already held
 *     (by secret) not added twice. Another device's phrase is only read: nothing is derived from
 *     it afterwards.
 *   - **Closing** refuses new operations and waits until every per-mint lock is idle, so the
 *     wallet (`wallet.ts` `close`) wipes the seed only when nothing derives from it.
 *
 * No cryptography here: blinding, signatures, DLEQ, P2PK witnesses and NUT-13 derivation are
 * cashu-ts calls, and a witness is signed by the injected `WalletKey` (the signer's `signSecret`,
 * or a wallet key held in secure memory).
