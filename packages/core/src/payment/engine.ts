/**
 * The real `PaymentEngine` (SECURITY.md invariants 1–6, threats T3–T8; contracts v5, ADR 0010).
 *
 * SEEDER SIDE — `verify` decides a PAY fully offline, before `ACK` (invariant 4), in the
 * contract's reason precedence: cheap structural and accounting checks first, the DLEQ math
 * last. Every check that matters is re-run synchronously in the same tick as the state change
 * it gates, so no interleaving — another peer's PAY, an upload, a `rebind` — can slip between a
 * check and its commit. PAYs from one peer are decided in arrival order (the carry chains them).
 *
 *   structure, range, core, carry     → malformed
 *   empty set whose share is > 0       → missing-seeder-set / missing-creator-set
 *   mint ∉ accepted ∩ policy           → mint-not-accepted          (T8)
 *   envelope not to own key / creator  → wrong-p2pk-target          (T4, T6)
 *   sums ≠ the carry-aware split       → overpay / wrong-amount     (invariant 2)
 *   a block not sent / already paid    → range-not-uploaded / range-already-paid (inv. 1)
 *   a proof without DLEQ               → missing-dleq
 *   DLEQ fails vs the cached keyset    → bad-dleq                   (T7)
 *   lock in the SECRET not a plain one
 *   to the recipient, or the creator
 *   set not bound to this seeder       → wrong-p2pk-target          (T4, T6, ADR 0010 §6)
 *   a secret already accepted          → double-spend + ban         (T5, invariant 6)
 *
 * `recordUpload` / `rebind` enforce the window synchronously (invariant 5): the crossing update
 * bans and fires `onWindowExceeded` before it returns. `flush` redeems the seeder sets at the mint
 * (a spent proof there is a double-spend: ban) and publishes the creator sets as NIP-61 nutzaps; a
 * mint or relay failure keeps the item for the next flush — the creator's money is never dropped.
 *
 * VIEWER SIDE — `pay` builds both locked sets through `Wallet.send` with the carry-aware split,
 * the creator set bound to the seeder (`['pay1', seeder P2PK]`). If the creator set cannot be
 * made after the seeder set was, the seeder set is kept and used first in the next PAY to that
 * seeder (it is locked to the seeder and cannot be taken back; this turns a loss into a delay).
 *
 * No cryptography here: DLEQ is cashu-ts `hasValidDleq`, secrets are parsed by cashu-ts, proofs
 * are made by the wallet. No proof material ever reaches a result, a detail, a callback or a
 * window snapshot (invariant 7).
