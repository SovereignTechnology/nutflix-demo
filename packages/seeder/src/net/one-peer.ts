/**
 * OnePeerRouter — every block a downloader asks the swarm for travels from ONE peer (security
 * review F33; Cameron, 2026-09-24: "request each range from a single seeder — no duplicates,
 * seeders paid fairly"), and no peer is ever asked for more blocks than its credit allows
 * (issue #8: the viewer's credit sized per seeder window). ADR 0018.
 *
 * WHY THIS REACHES INTO HYPERCORE. Hypercore chooses the peer a request goes to and offers no
 * public way to choose it. Its normal paths already give a block to one peer at a time: a queued
 * `get` is taken by the first peer able to serve it, and a range block is skipped while a request
 * for it is in flight. The one path that asks a SECOND peer for a block already in flight is the
 * hotswap (`Replicator._updateHotswap`): whenever a peer has spare capacity it re-requests blocks
 * in flight elsewhere (up to three peers per block); the first answer wins and the others are
 * cancelled, which is too late once they were sent. Each seeder counts what it sent and must be
 * paid for it (not paying window-cuts it), so a raced block is paid twice. Measured on piped
 * streams, three full seeders and 48 blocks read at once: 65–67 deliveries without this router,
 * 48 with it.
 *
 * What it changes on each attached core (hypercore 11.35.3; `__tests__/one-peer-router.test.ts`
 * pins every internal named here and fails loudly when one moves):
 *
 *   1. `replicator.hotswaps` becomes a queue that never races. `pick(peer)` yields a block only
 *      when its single request has STALLED (below), and as the replacement request goes out the
 *      stalled one is CANCELLED: a failover to one other peer, never two peers at once.
 *   2. Each replication `Peer`'s `getMaxInflight()` — hypercore's per-peer pipelining cap, read
 *      before every request it makes to that peer — is capped at
 *      `inflight + budget(remote, core) − used(remote)`, so what is outstanding at a peer never
 *      exceeds its credit, whichever blocks hypercore picks. Only the `UNCAPPED` sentinel leaves
 *      hypercore's own cap; anything else that is not a finite number ≥ 1 asks nothing.
 *   3. `refresh()` re-runs hypercore's scheduler (`updateAll()`) after a budget grew (an ACK, a
 *      HELLO), and while a request is stalled a ticker runs `updatePeer()` so a failover can fire.
 *   4. (fix round 4) with the `probe` option, a peer being probed on a core — a seeder not yet
 *      known to serve an image core free — is asked one block of it at a time.
 *
 * A request has STALLED when it is at least `stallMs` old AND its peer has delivered no block on
 * that core for `stallMs` (measured from the later of the request and the peer's last block): a
 * peer still delivering — an honest seeder on a slow link, its pipeline queued behind the blocks
 * it is sending — is never failed over; only a silent one is. A request `STALL_HARD_FACTOR ×
 * stallMs` old has stalled whatever its peer delivers, so a peer trickling other blocks cannot
 * hold one block back for ever.
 *
 * `used(remote)` is what the peer may have sent that nothing will pay yet: requests in flight and
 * blocks being verified, plus, for good, every request cancelled after it went out and every
 * request that died with its channel. The peer may have sent those; hypercore drops a late
 * answer, so it can never be paid, and the seeder still counts it against its window.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, ALWAYS:
 *   - When the internals are not what this was written against — the replicator, or any peer
 *     already on it — `attachCore` throws `RoutingUnsupported`: nothing downloads unrouted.
 *   - A peer that joins later without the pinned fields is asked for nothing (cap 0).
 *   - A replicator the router lets go of (the last detach, or `close()`) is PARKED, not handed
 *     back to hypercore's own scheduler: the core may still be replicating (shutdown closes the
 *     connections after the payer), and hypercore's cap (≥ 16) plus its racing hotswap would
 *     overrun every seeder the moment a block landed. Parked, every peer — and every peer that
 *     joins — is capped at 0 new requests and the no-race queue stays; blocks already in flight
 *     still land. The next `attachCore` of that core, by any router, takes it over, and a block
 *     still in flight there fails over as any other (the ticker restarts with the queue). No
 *     router hears a block land on a parked core, so every peer's quiet clock restarts at the
 *     takeover: a seeder that kept delivering is not failed over for the park, and a silent one
 *     fails over `stallMs` after the takeover.
 *
 * Runtime-neutral (Node and Bare): no Node imports, timers only.
