/**
 * PeerSession — one replication connection, as the seeder sees it.
 *
 * Identity: the Noise public key (transport, known at handshake) and, once `pay/1` `HELLO`
 * binds one, the Nostr pubkey (payment identity). Accounting always goes to the
 * `PaymentEngineSeeder` under `accountId()`; before `HELLO` that is the Noise key hex used
 * *as* the pubkey string (same 32-byte hex shape — the provisional identity of ADR 0004
 * (d)), and on `bindPubkey()` the engine moves that accounting onto the real pubkey with
 * `rebind(noiseHex, pubkey)` (per-core counts included, provisional entry dropped). A
 * viewer that never sends `HELLO` is therefore cut after `windowBlocks` like any other
 * non-payer.
 *
 * The cut (spike S-A, ADR 0003): `onUpload()` is called synchronously from Hypercore's
 * `upload` event, calls `recordUpload(id, {core, index..index}, pricing)` (synchronous by
 * contract; v5 records the block INDEX, ADR 0010), and if the returned window has
 * `outstanding > windowBlocks` bans (ban list + engine + hyperswarm `PeerInfo`) and destroys
 * the stream IN THE SAME TICK. No `await` anywhere on that path.
