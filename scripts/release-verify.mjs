// Issue #6 (security review F21, ADR 0017): verify a SIGNED desktop release event against the
// files you downloaded. Every check must pass, or it exits 1 and says which one failed:
//
//   1. the event is well-formed and its id and Schnorr signature verify (nostr-tools
//      verifyEvent — library crypto only);
//   2. it was signed by the SovTech key (npub1s0vtech…) — no other key is accepted, and there
//      is deliberately no option to accept one;
//   3. it is a desktop release notice: kind 30071, `d` = nutflix-desktop, and its `artifact`
//      tags, content (the SHA256SUMS text), `x` (sha256 of that text), `files` (the count) and
//      `size` (the total) agree; `commit`, when present, is a full 40-hex sha;
//   4. each file you name (or, with --all, every artifact of the release) is listed, and its
//      size and sha256 match.
// It prints the release's version, commit and creation date (the event's `created_at`: when
// the manifest was made, before it was signed): an OLDER genuine release also verifies (a
// signature cannot say "latest"), so compare them with the current notice (kind 30071,
// d = nutflix-desktop) on the relays before trusting a download to be current.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/release-verify.mjs <signed-event.json> <file>...        each file must match
//   node scripts/release-verify.mjs <signed-event.json> --all <dir>      every artifact, in <dir>
//
// It reads the files and the event; it contacts nothing.
