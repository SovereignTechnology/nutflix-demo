# Plans

- `build-plan.md` — v2 build plan (the *what*). Kept verbatim as the historical input;
  resolutions of its open assumptions live in `docs/decisions/0003-*.md`.
- `execution.md` — execution plan (the *how*). Prompts extracted to `docs/prompts/`; lane
  context/allowlists to `docs/lanes/BRIEFS.md`.
