# 4. Contracts v3: release-notice kind, `hyper://` grammar, per-core PAY, `rebind`

Date: 2026-09-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Stage 1 Wave 1 (L9, L1, L10, L2, L8) merged against `CONTRACTS_VERSION = 2`. It produced one
formal contract request (`docs/contract-requests/L9.md`), one doc/code divergence (L1 and L8
both implement a `hyper://` grammar the contract comment does not describe), and two flags
from L2 (`docs/lanes/L2.md` "Assumptions and decisions") that are not requests but describe
workarounds the seeder had to make inside the v2 shape. `docs/status.md` batched all of them
into one bump before Wave 2 so no Wave 2 lane is issued against a contract known to be wrong.

Constraint on the bump: `main` must stay green and every Wave 1 lane's merged code must still
compile, because re-issuing L2 and L10 is not in Wave 2's critical path. So v3 is **additive**.

## Decision

### (a) `NostrKind.ReleaseNotice = 30071`, not 30063

Build-plan §7 / threat T13 needs a Nostr kind for the reproducible-build hash event that the
org key signs. L9 asked for 30063 "from memory". The vendored `docs/vendor/NIP-51.md` defines
**30063 = "Release artifact sets"** with `d` = `<app-id>@<version>`, `e` tags pointing at
kind-1063 file-metadata events and an `a` tag to a kind-32267 software-application event.
Our event is a different shape (`d` = app id, `x` = sha256 of a dist *tree*, no 1063 events),
so reusing 30063 would collide with Zapstore-style consumers and mislead ours.

30071 is in the addressable range (30000–39999, so `d` makes it replaceable per app id) and
appears in no vendored spec (`grep -rhoE '\b3[0-9]{4}\b' docs/vendor/*.md`). Collision
policy: if a public registry assignment ever appears for 30071, the only two places to change
are `NostrKind.ReleaseNotice` and the `RELEASE_NOTICE_KIND` default in
`scripts/reproducible-build.mjs`; `scripts/__tests__/reproducible-build.test.ts` asserts the
two agree, because the `.mjs` cannot import the TS contracts. If Zapstore interop is ever
wanted, emit a real 30063 + 1063 pair *in addition*; L7 verifies against `ReleaseNotice`.

### (b) `hyperUrl` grammar is hex, and the contract now says so

`contracts/manifest.ts` said `hyper://<z32 core key>/<blob-id-encoded>`. What is actually
implemented — by L1 (`manifest/hyper-url.ts`), L8 (`media/hyper-url.ts`) and the fixtures the
contract told them to round-trip (`mocks/fixtures.ts`) — is
`hyper://<64-char lower-case hex core key>/<blockOffset>-<blockLength>[+<byteOffset>]`, with
`byteLength` taken from the imeta `size`. The code is consistent and tested; the comment was
wrong. Fixed the comment (and the `CoreKeyHex` primitive's remark). z32 is **not** accepted;
adding it later is a parser widening, not a contract change.

### (c) L2 flag 1 — `PayMessage` carries no core key → ACCEPTED: `BlockRange.core`

**The gap is real and it is a money-path gap, not an ergonomics one.** A Corestore
replication stream carries every core the two sides share over one `pay/1` channel; that is
how Corestore works and how a multi-video seeder or a gateway will always run. `PricePolicy`
is **per video** (`satsPerBlock`, `mints`, `split`, and above all `creatorP2pk` from the
creator's kind 10019). With no core in the `PAY`, the seeder cannot know which policy to
verify against, so:

- **T4 (stiff the creator)** is unverifiable: a viewer can lock the creator set to creator A's
  P2PK while downloading creator B's blocks, and the check passes if A's video is also seeded
  on that connection.
- **Invariant 2 (exact amount)** is unverifiable across videos with different
  `satsPerBlock`: pay the cheap video's price for the expensive video's blocks.
- **`range-not-uploaded` / `range-already-paid`** are per-core properties (block indexes are
  only meaningful inside a core), so a count-based aggregate check is all the engine can do.

L2's mitigation (one `PricePolicy` per seeder) is correct for a single-video seeder and wrong
for every other deployment, and it silently degrades to "cheapest price wins" as soon as an
operator seeds two videos. The alternative — one `pay/1` protomux channel per core, keyed by
discovery key like Hypercore's own channels — was considered and rejected: it multiplies
`HELLO` signatures and state machines by the number of cores, gives every core its own window
(weakening invariant 5's per-peer bound), and moves the identical information into a channel
id instead of a message field.

Change: `BlockRange.core?: CoreKeyHex`. `PayMessage.range.core` is therefore on the wire, the
viewer passes it through `pay()` unchanged in shape, and `recordUpload(peer, blocks, core?)`
lets the engine keep per-core upload counts. The window (invariant 5) stays **per peer summed
over cores** — that is the credit limit the seeder extends to one identity, and splitting it
per core would let a peer hold `window × cores` unpaid blocks.

**Optional at v3, required at the Stage 2 bump.** Optional only so that v2-issued L2/L10 code
compiles on `main` today (there are ~100 `{ fromBlock, toBlock }` literals in their tests).
The rule for the interim is written into the contract: a seeder that replicates more than one
core on a stream MUST reject a `PAY` without `core` as `malformed`. The mock applies the
per-core `range-not-uploaded` check whenever the PAY names a core for which uploads were
recorded, and the per-core replay check always (ranges on different cores never overlap).

### (d) L2 flag 2 — pre-`HELLO` accounting → ACCEPTED: `PaymentEngineSeeder.rebind(from, to)`

Hypercore starts serving blocks the instant the replication channel opens; `pay/1`'s `HELLO`
(which binds the Nostr pubkey) is a separate protomux channel and races it. Not serving before
`HELLO` is impossible (S-A: no per-peer pause) and cutting on the first pre-`HELLO` upload
would make the race unwinnable for honest viewers. So the transport must account pre-`HELLO`
uploads under a **provisional identity**. L2 uses the Noise static key as hex (same 32-byte
shape as a pubkey). That is sound: the Noise handshake authenticates it, the ban list already
persists Noise keys (invariant 6), a peer that never sends `HELLO` is cut and banned after
`window` blocks exactly like any non-payer, and a fresh Noise key per attempt buys at most
`window` blocks each — the same T3 residual as any anonymous peer, bounded by the per-key
connect-rate limit.

What is *not* sound is L2's replay: `recordUpload(pubkey, n)` on bind leaves the provisional
entry in place, so the engine's `windows()` double-counts `n` blocks, and once uploads are
tracked per core (c) a bare count cannot be replayed at all — the engine needs the per-core
breakdown. `rebind(from, to)` moves the whole accounting (uploaded, paid, paid ranges,
per-core counts, pending proofs, ban state) onto the real pubkey and deletes the provisional
entry. Merge semantics are **sum**: if `to` already has a window from another session, the
same identity now has both sessions' outstanding blocks, and if that sum crosses the window
the engine bans and fires `onWindowExceeded` synchronously — `rebind` is a window-changing
update and is held to the same rule as `recordUpload`. A ban on either side sticks to `to`.
Idempotent for an unknown `from`.

The seeder keeps the replay path until it is re-issued at v3 (it is contract-clean and
`n ≤ window` means it can never itself cut); the follow-up is listed in `docs/status.md`.

## Consequences

- `CONTRACTS_VERSION = 3`. All four changes are additive; `main` is green with every Wave 1
  lane's code untouched. `docs/lanes/BRIEFS.md` and the lane prompt slot now say v3.
- **Wave 2 lanes (L3 first) are issued against v3** and must: put `core` in every `PAY` they
  construct, call `recordUpload(peer, blocks, core)` with the core, and use `rebind` for the
  provisional-identity bind. The gateway is *the* multi-core case, so L3 is the first real
  consumer of (c).
- **Follow-ups owed (orchestrator, not Wave 2 critical path):** re-issue L2 at v3 — resolve
  policy per `range.core`, pass `core` to `recordUpload`, replace replay-on-bind with
  `rebind`, reject core-less `PAY` on multi-core streams, and reconcile
  `renderSystemdUnit()` with the canonical `deploy/systemd` unit; re-issue L10 at v3 — named
  tests for the T4-across-cores and cheap-price-across-cores cases, per-core replay, and
  `rebind` merge/ban semantics.
- **Stage 2 bump (v4) will make `BlockRange.core` and the `core` argument of `recordUpload`
  required.** The `pay/1` codec (Stage 2) encodes `core` as a fixed 32-byte field.
- `mocks/fixtures.ts` and `MockNetworkAdapter.comment()` now emit NIP-22 `E`/`K`/`P` +
  `e`/`k`/`p` tags via `commentTags()` instead of the invented `['A', '21:<id>']`, so the
  fixtures match what L1's `fetchComments` (`#E` filter) and `parseComment` read. L1's lenient
  `A` parsing stays for now; it can be removed when nothing emits the legacy shape.
